# Game Name: Retail Rumble

**Team Members:** Jack He

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
[example format: "It's like [Game X] meets [Game Y] but with [Unique Element Z]" (doesn't have to follow this format)]
It has game mechanics similar to Papa's Pizzeria and Paper's Please in which you're a cashier interacting with customers to find out more about them while tackling challenges with robberies, in-store events, rude customers, and more!

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
[Describe how the mechanic works, why it's fun/important, how it interacts with other mechanics, etc
You get to "collect" customer's stories, upgrade your store, and find out how long you can "survive," by scanning products correctly.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**

[Describe what players do, what they're trying to achieve, what challenges they face, and what rewards they get, etc]
Players will be scanning items with the cursor. During this time, you will be adding to your collection of products and customers you discover and will be trying to upkeep the demand of orders before they get impatient.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
[Describe your plan for sustaining gameplay]
You get a payment after each game, allowing you to upgrade your store to increase the amount of customers you can successfully bag items for. As you upgrade your stores, you will unlock new events and modes.
